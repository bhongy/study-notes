- If the resolution pass failed, webpack raises a runtime error. If webpack managed to resolve a file correctly, webpack performs processing over the matched file based on the loader definition. Each loader applies a specific transformation against the module *contents*.
- The way a loader gets matched against a resolved file can be configured in multiple ways, including *by file type* and *by location* within the file system. Webpack's flexibility even allows you to apply a specific transformation to a file based on *where* it was imported into the project.

- Assuming all loaders were found, webpack evaluates the matched loaders from bottom to top and right to left

Loaders can be chained. They are applied in a pipeline to the resource. A chain of loaders are executed in reverse order. The first loader in a chain of loaders returns a value to the next. At the end loader, webpack expects JavaScript to be returned.

- Loaders can be synchronous or asynchronous.
- Loaders run in Node.js and can do everything thatâ€™s possible there.
- Loaders can emit additional arbitrary files.

It doesn't touch any split bundles unless `allChunks: true` is set true. The Bundle Splitting chapter digs into greater detail.
